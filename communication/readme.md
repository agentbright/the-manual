Communication
=============

Tools
-----

* We avoid email at all costs, unless the matter is private or sensitive.
* We use comments in the Github issue/PR to discuss specific issues.
* We use Basecamp for bigger picture discussions
* We use Flowdock for chat

Working Remotely
----------------

* We work remotely and asynchronously, which has many fantastic benefits.
* In order for it to be successful, it requires that everyone individually
  can strike a good balance between being responsive to the team and being
  productive.
* Responding quickly to messages is important to keeping the flow going, but
  just as important is quiet, uninterrupted working time in order to get things
  done.
* We are mindful of this challenge, and aware that working remotely means
  everyone has to work a little bit harder to keep communicating and keep
  things moving.
