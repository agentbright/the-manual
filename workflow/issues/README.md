Issues
======

* We divide our work into **issues**, which are often times stories or story
  components
* Issues are planned and scheduled on Trello boards, and then raised and
  assigned in Github.
* We catagories issues as either a **Feature**, **Engineering**, or a
  **Bug**.

Story Points
------------

* We internally assign either 1, 2 or 3 story points to each feature or
  engineering issue.
* The points are based on very subjective combination of estimated complexity
  and estimated time.
* Estimating issue time and complexity is fraught with challenges, and usually
  not very accurate. We are very aware of this.
  
Here is how we view story points:

* Using story points is like being on a hike through the woods, and using the
  sun to figure out what time it is and which direction we are going.
* We know there are people out there who are very good at using the sun for
  these things, but we are not those people.
* We can use the sun to give us a very, VERY rough estimate of our bearings,
  and we're always looking to improve our technique, but it's not reliable
  and we know it.
* Moral of the story: story points exist, but we don't waste time fretting over
  them or debating them, and we only really even acknowledge them at a very high
  level, and with many, many grains of salt.
